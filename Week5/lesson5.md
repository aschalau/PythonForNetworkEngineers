Copy your solution from exercise3 to exercise4. Add an 'import pdb' and pdb.set_trace() statement outside of your function (i.e. where you have your function calls).

Inside of pdb, experiment with:

   Listing your code. <br>
   Using 'next' and 'step' to walk through your code. Make sure you understand the difference between next and step. <br>
   Experiment with 'up' and 'down' to move up and down the code stack. <br>
   Use p <variable> to inspect a variable. <br>
   Set a breakpoint and run your code to the breakpoint. <br>
   Use '!command' to change a variable (for example !new_mac = []) <br>
