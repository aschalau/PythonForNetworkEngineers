## Exercises

Reference code for these exercises is posted on GitHub at:
    https://github.com/ktbyers/pynet/tree/master/learning_python/lesson5


1. Create an ssh_conn function. This function should have three parameters: ip_addr, username, and password. The function should print out each of these three variables and clearly indicate which variable it is printing out.

   Call this ssh_conn function using entirely positional arguments.

   Call this ssh_conn function using entirely named arguments.

   Call this ssh_conn function using a mix of positional and named arguments.

2. Expand on the ssh_conn function from exercise1 except add a fourth parameter 'device_type' with a default value of 'cisco_ios'. Print all four of the function variables out as part of the function's execution.

   Call the 'ssh_conn2' function both with and without specifying the device_type

   Create a dictionary that maps to the function's parameters. Call this ssh_conn2 function using the **kwargs technique.

3.  Create a function that randomly generates an IP address for a network. The default base network should be '10.10.10.'. For simplicity the network will always be a /24.

    You should be able to pass a different base network into your function as an argument.

    Randomly pick a number between 1 and 254 for the last octet and return the full IP address.

    You can use the following to randomly generate the last octet:

    import random <br>
    random.randint(1, 254)

    Call your function using no arguments. <br>
    Call your function using a positional argument. <br>
    Call your function using a named argument. <br>

    For each function call print the returned IP address to the screen.

4. Similar to lesson3, exercise4 write a function that normalizes a MAC address to the following format:

   01:23:45:67:89:AB

   This function should handle the lower-case to upper-case conversion.

   It should also handle converting from '0000.aaaa.bbbb' and from '00-00-aa-aa-bb-bb' formats.

   The function should have one parameter, the mac_address. It should return the normalized MAC address

   Single digit bytes should be zero-padded to two digits. In other words, this:

   a:b:c:d:e:f

   should be converted to:

   0A:0B:0C:0D:0E:0F

   Write several test cases for your function and verify it is working properly.

5. Copy your solution from exercise3 to exercise4. Add an 'import pdb' and pdb.set_trace() statement outside of your function (i.e. where you have your function calls).

   Inside of pdb, experiment with:

   Listing your code. <br>
   Using 'next' and 'step' to walk through your code. Make sure you understand the difference between next and step. <br>
   Experiment with 'up' and 'down' to move up and down the code stack. <br>
   Use p <variable> to inspect a variable. <br>
   Set a breakpoint and run your code to the breakpoint. <br>
   Use '!command' to change a variable (for example !new_mac = []) <br>
